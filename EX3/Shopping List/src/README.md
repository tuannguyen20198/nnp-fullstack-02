**Acceptance criteria:**

<input type="checkbox" checked> The shown list of items should be driven from React state. We can remove the placeholder foods, and start with an empty list

<input type="checkbox" checked> Submitting the form should add a new item to the list, and show it in the UI

<input type="checkbox" checked> When submitting the form, the text input should be reset, so that it's empty. This way, users can easily add multiple items without having to erase their previous entry.

<input type="checkbox" checked> There should be no “key” warnings in the console. Ideally, you **shouldn't** use the index for the key.
